# canvas
This project was made a part of a class project, was supposed to be a webshop, but it turned out to be a Final Fantasy I party builder.
The generic idea is that you select a background, add characters to your party (going to work like a cart), up to 4 characters, and it is drawn on a canvas.
From which you can generate an image.
